# üéØ Recommended Windows Installation Strategy

## For Regular Users (No Python Required) ‚≠ê

### Option 1: Chocolatey (Recommended)
```cmd
# Install Chocolatey (one-time setup)
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install Shift
choco install shift
```

### Option 2: Standalone Download
1. Download `shift.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/adamn1225/shift/releases/latest)
2. Place in a folder (e.g., `C:\Tools\`)
3. Add that folder to your PATH

### Option 3: WinGet (Modern Windows)
```cmd
winget install adamn1225.shift
```

## For Developers (Who Have Python) üêç

```cmd
pip install shift
```

## The Reality Check ‚úÖ

**You're 100% correct!** Most Windows users don't have Python installed. That's why:

1. **Chocolatey is perfect** - It handles standalone executables
2. **Your `.nuspec` file is already set up correctly** 
3. **Direct executable download works best** for non-technical users

## What You Have vs What Users Need

| Installation Method | User Type | Python Required? | Your Status |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Chocolatey | All users | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Ready |
| Direct Download | All users | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Ready |
| WinGet | Windows 10+ | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Ready |
| pip install | Developers | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Ready |

## Recommendation: Lead with Chocolatey + Standalone

Your current setup is actually **perfect** because:
- Chocolatey package works without Python
- You have standalone executable options
- pip is just a bonus for Python developers

The key is **marketing it correctly** to users!
