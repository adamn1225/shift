# 🚀 One-Liner Installation Readiness

## ❓ **Your Question: Will this work once pushed to GitHub?**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamn1225/shift/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## ⚠️ **Short Answer: Not quite yet!**

The script will **download and run**, but it will **fail to install** because the required files don't exist yet.

## 🔍 **What Happens When Someone Runs It Today:**

```
🚀 Installing Shift CLI...
📦 Installing via pip...        ❌ FAILS (not on PyPI)
🍫 Installing via Chocolatey... ❌ FAILS (not published)
⬇️ Downloading standalone...    ❌ FAILS (no GitHub release)
❌ Installation failed
Manual installation options:
1. pip install shift           ❌ Not available
2. choco install shift         ❌ Not available  
3. Download from releases      ❌ No releases yet
```

## ✅ **What You Need to Make It Work:**

### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Release (Critical!)**
The script tries to download from:
```
https://github.com/adamn1225/shift/releases/latest/download/shift.exe
```

**You need to:**
1. Build Windows executable: `pyinstaller --clean shift.spec` (on Windows)
2. Create GitHub release at: `https://github.com/adamn1225/shift/releases`
3. Upload the `shift.exe` file to that release

### **Step 2: Quick Test Strategy**
```bash
# Build a test executable (you can use the Linux one for now)
cp dist/shift dist/shift.exe

# Create a GitHub release and upload shift.exe
# Then test your one-liner!
```

## 🎯 **Timeline to Working One-Liner:**

| What | When | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| **Push current code** | Now | Script downloads but fails |
| **Create release + upload exe** | +30 mins | ✅ One-liner works! |
| **Publish to PyPI** | +1 hour | pip install works too |
| **Submit to Chocolatey** | +2 hours | choco install works too |

## 🚀 **Bottom Line:**

Your script is **perfectly written** and will work great! You just need to:

1. **Create a GitHub release** with the Windows executable
2. **Upload `shift.exe`** to that release

Then your one-liner will work beautifully for anyone! 

The script is smart - it tries multiple installation methods and falls back gracefully. Once you have the release, users will get a seamless installation experience. 🎉
